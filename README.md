# Customer Review Classifier

### About Dataset

[Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)

This dataset consists of a few million Amazon customer reviews (input text) and star ratings (output labels) for learning how to train fastText for sentiment analysis.

The idea here is a dataset is more than a toy - real business data on a reasonable scale - but can be trained in minutes on a modest laptop.

### Content

The fastText supervised learning tutorial requires data in the following format:

`__label__<X> __label__<Y> ... <Text>`

where X and Y are the class names. No quotes, all on one line.

In this case, the classes are `__label__1` and `__label__2`, and there is only one class per row.

`__label__` corresponds to 1- and 2-star reviews, and `__label__2` corresponds to 4- and 5-star reviews.

(3-star reviews i.e. reviews with neutral sentiment were not included in the original),

The review titles, followed by ':' and a space, are prepended to the text.

Most of the reviews are in English, but there are a few in other languages, like Spanish.

### Source

The data was lifted from Xiang Zhang's Google Drive dir, but it was in .csv format, not suitable for fastText.
